## Intro and Overview
A public version of Unity's internal Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC). Meant to provide an example framework, not just to share with other, but to also take contributions and continue to improve and evolve.

The Unity Security Team has spent a lot of work to improve the trustworthiness of Unity's products and services. As part of that, we developed our own internal SSDLC to help our developers design and develop more secure products. After a couple iterations, we found that we had an interesting collection of articles and trainings that may be useful for not just Unity's developers, but potentially other organizations as well. So we decided to share what we have, hopefully to contribute something back to the broader software security community.

We know this isn't perfect - there's rough edges, probably some typos and embarassing grammar, and it's certainly not close to being exhaustive. But, there's definitely useful information here. Not only the actual data, but we wanted to just share with other companies what an actual, in use, SSDLC might look like.
This this in mind, please be kind in your contructive criticism, and let us know if you've found this 
useful!

## Unity SSDLC Structure
Our SSDLC is actually a suite of offering by the Application Security team. Part documentation, part training (in person and online) and a fun CTF server we host.
#### SSDLC  Documentation
The SSDLC is an ever evolving set of documents that our team has drafted as an attempt to capture industry best practices in a single location for our developers. The recommendations aren't perfect, and are always in draft. We have gaps, both in the technology we cover and how deep we are in each topic. However, we felt it better to share with our developers (and you!) as much as we could  - it does no good for us to hoard a complete library of knowledge because we're missing _just one more article_ :)

This SSDLC is intended to be a practical reference for developers to help them design and develop more secure products spread over 3 main topic: [Coding Practice](./Coding%Practice), [Language Guidance](./Language%20Guidance), and [Security Process](./Security%20Process).
#### Trainings
As a further supplemt to our SSDLC, the Unity Security team has developed several presentation to deliver more entertaining security content. The training was built with the intent to deliver the sessions in-person, as part of mini internal security conferences. Ideally, we'd also record these presentations to share with folks who can't make it to the live sessions.

We can't share all our presentations here. We wanted to make these relevant and personal to the teams we present to, so many contain findings in our own products, with real-time demos of us exploiting the vulnerabilities we've discoved in our own code! In this way, developers can see the real risk of insecure code, potentially in the code they wrote themselves :) We never shame or call out teams or specifically developers - this is meant to be a learning experience, not a hurtful one.

##### CTF(s)
To go along with our mini-conferences, we also run a small CTF along side the presentations. This is meant to give our development teams the opportunity to have a hands-on experience with insecure code, starting with very simple examples, working up to more advanced challenges. This is not meant to be a full fledged Defcon-style CTF - we just want to teach some security basic, and whet the hacking appetite of our teams :) 

## Contributions
We're still working on how to accept contributions. Once we figure out that process, we'll post the details here and open up our repo accordingly.
