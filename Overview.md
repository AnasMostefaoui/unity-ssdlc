### Unity SSDLC Overview

<<<<<<< HEAD
The goal of Unity's SSDLC provide product teams and developers best practices on how to leverage software security practices into their existing development process. The phases in the graphic above may not be formally implemented or recognized by your team, but they do generally represent how all software is developed, implicitly or explicitly. Following this model, you are able to best determine what services the Unity Security team provides based on what phase of of the development life-cycle you are currently in with your product.

The SSDLC will continue to evolve, and include services from the broader Security teams; we'll soon be adding links to docukments from our Program Management team, Infrastructure Security, SOC, Incident Response, and Application Security.
